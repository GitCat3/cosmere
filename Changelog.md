B33

Coinshots can now shoot coins! Crouch and right click a coin pouch to open pouch inventory and add metal nuggets. 
Then hold your allomancy push keybind and use (right click) the coin pouch. You'll shoot out a projectile that you'll automatically be pushing against.
If you have allomantic iron, you can pull those projectiles directly back into your coin pouch or inventory.

Removed accidental character left in village_blacksmith loot table json.
Hemalurgic Tin, Copper, Chromium, Aluminum spikes implemented.
Added Bands Of Mourning creative item. Grants allomancy & feruchemy.
Fixed metal vial amounts. Made nuggets annoying to eat, to encourage vial use.

B25
Fixed some loot chests not being injected into
Implemented ability for partially charged unsealed metalminds to be found in loot chests.
Updated metal trader potential trades, now sets costs, amounts, trades per day and xp per trade based on item rarity.
Updated a lot of loot chest loot. Look for hemalurgically charged spikes, invested metalminds and atium/lerasium beads and raw ore in various chests. Still checking that I've got the loot tables working correctly, but I was able to get things to show up rarely in chests.

B23

Duralumin feruchemy tapping gives Hero of the Village effect.
Fixed a crash related to bronze feruchemy. Player can now sleep at night anywhere properly.

Consume minecraft:iron/gold nuggets. 
Lerasium & Lerasatium can be consumed to gain powers. 
Added missing localisation for hemalurgic spike creative mode tab. 
Fixed bronze allomancy glow effect.


B21

Fixed Mixin related crash

B20

Localisation should now use "manifestation type - metal type" instead of the name of the manifestation for allomancy and feruchemy. Eg "Feruchemical Steel" instead of Steelrunner.
Fixed some balancing of the metalminds, so that it's 1000 capacity per ingot used to make it.

B19

The creative mode menu now has a more comprehensive list of hemalurgic spikes with the abilities that they can steal
Remove our own Gold/Iron Nuggets from being created.
Added metalmind descriptions to JEI/NEI
Stop the game crashing when patchouli isn't installed, oops
Shortened allomancy guide book listings, as it doesn't create extra pages for you if you throw too much at it.
Use pewter nugget for allomancy icon in guide book for now. Was metal vial which has no icon yet.

Changed Gold feruchemy to have lower hearts when storing and then regen-like effect when tapping.
Prep for cosmere related loot to start showing up in chests
Making allomancy last longer than a few seconds per bead. now lasts between 60-180 seconds. Easier for testing till we adjust burn rates by metal.

Fixed a bug where allomancy users would gain more metals when burning instead of less. oops.

Initial framework for patchouli datagen provider. Wont have to make a couple hundred json completely by hand anymore
Initial framework for advancement datagen provider. 
Visual updates to ring/bracelet png.

Fixed a bug where player powers were not persisting across death.
Big spiritweb menu refactor, now I actually understand what's going on there.

B14

Adding illagers and witches to possible powered individuals.
Adding electrum feruchemy. Not sure how happy I am with it. Reduces/increases damage taken a small amount. Any suggestions on what storing/tapping determination could do would be appreciated.
Have also removed annoying mode change message and updated the debug text so it says selected power and what mode the selected power is in.
Big refactor to convert to using attributes instead of capability to track what powers you currently have access to.

B13

All feruchemy basically done except for nicrosil and electrum.
Players are twinborn at a minimum, or they are granted either full allomancy or full feruchemy.
Fine tuned feruchemical bronze storing, so it doesnâ€™t spam chat with sleep messages.
Fine tuned brass feruchemy, so that tapping brass actually does something. Sets others on fire if tapping enough when attacking. Sets self on fire if tapping too much.

B12

Following 1.17 style of ore blocks dropping raw ore, rather than the block itself.
Raw ore is affected by fortune.
Alloys are made out of raw ore for the most part. Recipes are visible in the JEI mod.
Fixed up tin feruchemy so it provides zoom instead of night vision.
Fixed night vision in tin allomancy so it doesnâ€™t spam flash the screen on low night vision timer left.

B11

World generation done! You can find the new ores out in the world now.
Zinc feruchemy gives more experience when tapping, less experience when storing.
Gold feruchemy acts more like poison and regeneration, except the reduced health is dependent on how much health you are storing.
Storing identity with duralumin will hide your nameplate if youâ€™re storing enough. Visibility to mobs is also dependent on how much youâ€™re storing

B9

Ore blocks exist but not generating in the world

B8 and below.

Initial commit, never kept track of what the build had then really.
Some feruchemy,
basic gui,
swallowing metal for allomancy etc.
Hemalurgy initial pass too.
Compounding also is in there.
